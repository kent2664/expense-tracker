# Expense-Tracker
This is an expense tracker designed for personal use.
Not only does it help users manage expenses easily, but it also quickly alerts them when their spending gets close to the per-category budget.


## Features
- Expense Management  
    You can easily enter the expense amount, and in addition, you can choose categories intuitively.
- Categories watcher  
    Once the entered expense exceeds 90% of the budget, the budget amount will be highlighted with a yellow background. And when the expense is over 100% of the budget, the budget amount will be highlighted in red.
- Persistence
    It uses Local Storage to save and retrieve data. Therefore, the data will be converted to a string value in this program.
- Summary
    The users are able to see total expense and budget. The total budget involves all of the category budgets. If there is a warning (or: If a warning is issued), the bell icon's badge will blink.
